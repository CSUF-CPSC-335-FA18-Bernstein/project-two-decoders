Hypothesis:

This experiment will test the following hypotheses:

* Randomization can be used to generate data for testing an algorithm and determining performance.
* Two algorithms of the same efficiency class can have different average running times and different ranges of performance.

---

Testing:

* In order to test the performance of an algorithm it is necessary to run it on a variety of different inputs (instances of the problem). 
* Since there are an “infinite” number of possible inputs to an algorithm we need to generate random data sets in order to test a wide range of inputs.
